# Node.js-MySQL
Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and Node.js. It is comprised of two apps - one for customer orders and one for manager actions. Uses basic functions of persistant storage. All 4 CRUD database operations used - INSERT, SELECT, UPDATE and DELETE SQL queries. Used an exported constructor file to display the inventory in both bamazonCustomer.js and bamazonManager.js

BamazonCustomer:

displays a table with the inventory
takes a customer's order
computes the cost
depletes the stock from the store's inventory
BamazonManager - allows a manager to:

View Products for Sale
View Low Inventory
Add to Inventory
Add New Product
Delete a Product
